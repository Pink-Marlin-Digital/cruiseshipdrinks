/**
 * This project must adhere to atomic UI design theory.
 * Reference: https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/
 *
 * Atomic design organizes UI components into a hierarchy:
 *
 * - Atoms: Basic building blocks (e.g., buttons, inputs, labels, text, icons).
 * - Molecules: Groups of atoms composed together to form meaningful units (e.g., input group, card with title and icon).
 * - Organisms: Relatively complex, distinct UI sections built from molecules and atoms (e.g., header, feature section, footer).
 *
 * All new and updated components/pages must map to an atomic tier, be grouped under
 * the matching `src/components/atoms`, `molecules`, or `organisms` folders, and strive for maximum reusability and clarity.
