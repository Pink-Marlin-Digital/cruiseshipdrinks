# Rule: Write Code That Is Intentionally Structured, Readable, and Self-Documenting

## Required Behaviors
1. Use descriptive and consistent naming for variables, functions, and modules.
2. Organize code so that related logic appears together and control flow is easy to follow.
3. Prefer clear, direct expressions over clever or compressed code that obscures intent.
4. Ensure functions are short enough that their role can be understood at a glance.
5. Use comments only to explain intent or context, not basic mechanics.
6. Format code according to the project's established conventions.

## Example Pattern
```ts
export async function fetchActiveUsers(apiClient) {
  // Validate the dependency
  if (!apiClient || typeof apiClient.fetchUsers !== "function") {
    throw new Error("A valid apiClient with a fetchUsers method is required.");
  }

  // Fetch all users in a clear, readable step
  const users = await apiClient.fetchUsers();

  // Filter with an explicit and self explanatory condition
  const activeUsers = users.filter(user => user.status === "active");

  return activeUsers;
}
```
